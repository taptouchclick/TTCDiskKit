Use this however you like.

For percentages, do division.

If you make something with it, show me, but you're free to use it.


Notes:
-I chose to return NSStrings rather than float values because in the situation where I used it, 
I wanted the values to be trimmed at the 2nd decimal place. 
I plan to release a new version of this in the future

Requests:
-ability to request different lengths and get percentages, etc.
